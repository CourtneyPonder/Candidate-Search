# Candidate Search

This application lets you search candidates using GitHub API so you can easily find information needed.

## User story
```
AS AN employer
I WANT a candidate search application
SO THAT I can hire the best candidates
```

## Resources 
I had the help of the bootcamp course materials, github documentation, and some chatGPT.

## Disclaimer
